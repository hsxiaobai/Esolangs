# What is it?
There are some modules for running Esolangs.
# How to use it?
Every module has a class.You can use the class to construct a module and use the function 'grammarAnalysis' to analysis the grammar.You must run the module in the class because the memory is defined in the class.However,some Esolangs can't be compiled.So you should use the function 'interpret' to run it.
